# Reddiverse

**Reddiverse** is a real-time multiplayer voxel game engine built for Reddit's Devvit platform. It combines procedural world generation, multiplayer synchronization, and a programmable block system to create an immersive 3D experience where players can explore, build, and create custom game mechanics.

## üåç Multiple Biomes

Reddiverse features three distinct biomes, each with unique terrain generation and visual characteristics:

### **Greenery** üå±
- Lush grasslands with rolling hills and valleys
- Dense forests with various tree types
- Water bodies and rivers
- Rich vegetation and foliage

### **Desert** üèúÔ∏è
- Vast sand dunes and arid landscapes
- Sparse vegetation with different cactus types
- Low elevation with minimal water features
- Warm, dry climate simulation

### **Mountains** ‚õ∞Ô∏è
- Steep rocky terrain with dramatic elevation changes
- Snow-capped peaks at high altitudes
- Challenging vertical landscapes
- Cool climate with snow overlays

The modular biome system makes it easy to add new biomes by extending the terrain generation parameters and visual assets.

#### **Example Smart Block Configurations**
```typescript
// Lava Block - Damages player
{
  name: "Custom Lava",
  onClick: [{ type: "setLife", mode: "subtract", value: 20 }]
}

// Winner Block - Triggers victory
{
  name: "Victory Block", 
  onTouch: [{ type: "setWinner", value: true }]
}

// Status Block - Changes player badge
{
  name: "Elite Block",
  onClick: [{ type: "setBadge", value: "elite" }]
}

// Modified Jumper - Extra high jump
{
  name: "Super Jumper",
  onTouch: [{ type: "impulse", axis: "y", amount: 15 }]
}
```
